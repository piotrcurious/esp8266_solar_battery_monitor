7s lithium battery monitoring system to display voltage of all cells in the pack.

Designed to be used with my IR_serial library.
There are code bits to encode error check redundancy messages (generated by Claude)

This allows Arduino uno to output cell voltages over infeared diode.

receiver can be another Arduino, esp32 with display or anything else. 

error codes allow devices which rely on error free data (like charger or balancer) to be certain data is correct. 
For mere visualization error codes are obsolete so there is power saving version too.

Designed as a simple gauge to check state of individual cells in a battery pack.
