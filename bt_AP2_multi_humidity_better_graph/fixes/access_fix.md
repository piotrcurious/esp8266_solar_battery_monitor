 I apologize for the misunderstanding in my previous response. You're right, and it's an important point that the `plotGraphSection` function needs access to the entire row of the buffer, not just a single value. Let's modify Solution 1 to accommodate this requirement while maintaining the flexibility of using function pointers for different buffer layouts.

#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

// Define a new type for the row access function
typedef float* (*BufferRowAccessFunc)(void* buffer, int row);

// Function to access a row in a 2D array
float* access_2d_array_row(void* buffer, int row) {
    return ((float(*)[])buffer)[row];
}

// Function to access a row in a 1D array representing a 2D array
float* access_1d_array_row(void* buffer, int row) {
    return &((float*)buffer)[row * BUFFER_SIZE];
}

void plotGraphMulti(void* minutes_buffer, BufferRowAccessFunc accessRowFunc, 
                    uint16_t bufferNumbers, uint16_t dataSize,
                    uint16_t graphPosX, uint16_t graphPosY,
                    uint16_t graphWidth, uint16_t graphHeight) {
    for (int j = 0; j < dataSize - 1; j++) {
        for (uint8_t i = 0; i < NUMBER_OF_GRAPHS; i++) {
            bool clear_under = (i == 0);
            if (graph_order[i] >= 0 && graph_order[i] < bufferNumbers) {
                float* row = accessRowFunc(minutes_buffer, graph_order[i]);
                plotGraphSection(row, j, dataSize, graphPosX, graphPosY, graphWidth, graphHeight,
                    minutes_buffer_min[graph_order[i]], minutes_buffer_max[graph_order[i]],
                    GRAPH_COLOR[graph_order[i]], clear_under);
            }
        }
    }
    graphComplete = true;
}

// Updated plotGraphSection function signature
void plotGraphSection(float* buffer_row, int j, uint16_t dataSize,
                      uint16_t graphPosX, uint16_t graphPosY,
                      uint16_t graphWidth, uint16_t graphHeight,
                      float min, float max, uint16_t color, bool clear_under) {
    // Implementation here
    // You can access buffer_row[j], buffer_row[j+1], etc.
}

// Usage example
void example_usage() {
    float buffer_2d[10][100];
    float buffer_1d[10 * 100];

    // For 2D array
    plotGraphMulti(buffer_2d, access_2d_array_row, 10, 100, 10, 10, 100, 100);

    // For 1D array representing 2D data
    plotGraphMulti(buffer_1d, access_1d_array_row, 10, 100, 10, 10, 100, 100);
}

Here's an explanation of the changes and how this solution addresses your needs:

1. New Row Access Function Type:
   - We've defined a new function pointer type `BufferRowAccessFunc` that returns a pointer to a float (i.e., a row of the buffer).

2. Row Access Functions:
   - `access_2d_array_row` and `access_1d_array_row` now return pointers to the start of a row in their respective buffer types.

3. Updated `plotGraphMulti`:
   - The function now uses `accessRowFunc` to get a pointer to the entire row of the buffer.
   - It passes this row pointer to `plotGraphSection`, allowing it to access the entire row.

4. Modified `plotGraphSection`:
   - The function signature now takes a `float* buffer_row` instead of a single float value.
   - This allows `plotGraphSection` to perform operations on the entire row as needed.

5. Usage:
   - The usage remains similar, but you pass the appropriate row access function depending on your buffer type.

This solution maintains the flexibility of the original function pointer approach while allowing `plotGraphSection` to access the entire row of the buffer. It works with both 2D arrays and 1D arrays representing 2D data, and you can easily add support for other data layouts by creating new row access functions.

Key benefits:
1. Flexibility: Works with different buffer layouts.
2. Performance: Passes pointers, avoiding unnecessary copying.
3. Compatibility: Maintains a C-style approach, suitable for C codebases or embedded systems.

To integrate this into your existing code:
1. Update your `plotGraphSection` function to accept a row pointer instead of a single value.
2. Implement the appropriate row access functions for your buffer types.
3. Update the calls to `plotGraphMulti` to use the appropriate row access function.

Would you like me to explain any part of this solution in more detail or help with integrating it into your specific codebase?
