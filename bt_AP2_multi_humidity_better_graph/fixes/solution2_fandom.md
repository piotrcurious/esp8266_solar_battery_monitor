 I apologize for any confusion. The specific solution I presented is not a widely known or standardized approach that I can definitively say is used in open-source programs. It's a custom solution designed to address the particular requirements you described.

However, the general concepts used in this solution - such as function pointers for flexible data access, structs for encapsulating data and behavior, and abstracting array access - are common in C programming and are used in various open-source projects. Let me provide some examples of open-source projects that use similar concepts:

1. SQLite: 
   SQLite uses function pointers extensively to implement its virtual table interface. This allows for flexible data access methods similar to our solution.

2. Linux Kernel:
   The Linux kernel uses structs with function pointers (similar to our `Buffer2D` struct) to implement its virtual filesystem (VFS) layer. This allows different filesystem types to provide their own implementations of standard operations.

3. FFmpeg:
   FFmpeg, a popular multimedia framework, uses function pointers and structs to handle different codecs and formats in a flexible manner.

4. libpng:
   The libpng library, used for reading and writing PNG files, uses structs with function pointers to handle different pixel formats and transformations.

5. OpenSSL:
   OpenSSL uses function pointers within structs to implement its ENGINE API, allowing for pluggable cryptographic implementations.

While these projects don't use the exact solution we discussed, they employ similar programming patterns to achieve flexibility and abstraction in C.

If you're looking for a more standardized approach to handling 2D data in C, you might want to consider libraries like:

1. GSL (GNU Scientific Library): 
   It provides a comprehensive set of functions for handling matrices and vectors.

2. BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms):
   A standard interface for performing basic vector and matrix operations.

These libraries have been widely used and tested in scientific and engineering applications.

Would you like me to explain how any of these open-source projects or libraries handle flexible data access, or discuss how you might adapt their approaches to your specific needs?
