 Certainly! There are indeed more elegant solutions we can explore using C++ techniques. Let's look at a few approaches that can make our code more flexible and easier to use.

Let me explain each solution:

1. Using std::vector:
   - This solution uses C++'s standard library container `std::vector`.
   - It's very flexible as it can handle dynamically sized buffers.
   - The function takes a reference to a vector of vectors, making it safe and efficient.
   - It automatically deduces the buffer sizes from the vector dimensions.

2. Using a template function:
   - This solution is the most flexible as it can work with any 2D container-like type.
   - It will work with `std::vector`, `std::array`, and even C-style arrays.
   - The compiler generates the appropriate code based on the type passed.

3. Using a macro for C-style arrays:
   - This solution is best if you're constrained to using C-style arrays.
   - The `ARRAY_SIZE` macro safely calculates the size of the array.
   - The `PLOT_GRAPH_MULTI` macro encapsulates the entire plotting logic.
   - It's less type-safe than the C++ solutions but works well with older codebases.

Each of these solutions has its strengths:
- Solution 1 is best if you're already using `std::vector` or can switch to it.
- Solution 2 is the most flexible and works with both modern C++ containers and C-style arrays.
- Solution 3 is best if you need to stick with C-style arrays and macros.

The choice between these depends on your specific constraints and the rest of your codebase. If you're working in a modern C++ environment, I'd recommend Solution 2 for its flexibility. If you're working in a more C-style codebase, Solution 3 might be more appropriate.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these solutions or discuss how to integrate them into your existing code?
