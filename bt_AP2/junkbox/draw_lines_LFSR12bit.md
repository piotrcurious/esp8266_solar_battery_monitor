To improve the code to use a Galois LFSR that loops over a range of 4096 iterations, we'll make the following adjustments:

1. **Expand the LFSR to 12 bits**: A 12-bit LFSR can generate 4095 unique values, so we'll use this to loop over a range of 4096 iterations (0 to 4095).
2. **Wrap the sequence**: Ensure the LFSR sequence correctly wraps around to cover exactly 4096 iterations.
3. **Adjust the `maxLines`**: We’ll adjust the logic so that it maps the 12-bit LFSR output to the number of lines in the buffer.

Here’s the improved code:

### Implementation:

```cpp
#include <stdint.h>

// Define the number of iterations for the LFSR
#define LFSR_MAX_ITERATIONS 4096

// Variables to store the current state of the LFSR and maximum lines
uint16_t lfsr = 1;  // Initial seed value for the 12-bit LFSR
int maxLines = MAX_LINES;  // Set this to the maximum number of lines in the buffer

// Function to implement a 12-bit Galois LFSR
uint16_t galoisLFSR() {
    uint16_t lsb = lfsr & 1;  // Get the least significant bit
    lfsr >>= 1;               // Shift the LFSR right by 1
    if (lsb) {
        // Apply the polynomial (0xB400 corresponds to the polynomial x^12 + x^11 + x^10 + x^4 + 1)
        lfsr ^= 0xB400 >> 4;  // Use the relevant 12-bit polynomial, shifting by 4 to match 12 bits
    }
    return lfsr;
}

// Function to draw a specified number of lines based on the LFSR sequence
void drawLinesUsingLFSR(int numLinesToDraw) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numLinesToDraw; i++) {
        // Generate the next LFSR value and mod by maxLines to ensure it's within the range
        uint16_t lfsrValue = galoisLFSR();
        uint16_t lineIndex = lfsrValue % maxLines;

        // Ensure the generated index is within the range of valid buffered lines
        if (lineIndex < lineBufferIndex) {
            drawBufferedLine(lineIndex);
        }

        // Reset the LFSR if we complete 4096 iterations
        if (lfsrValue == 0) {
            lfsr = 1;  // Reset the LFSR to the initial seed value
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **12-bit LFSR Implementation**:
   - **LFSR Seed (`lfsr`)**: We continue using a 16-bit variable to store the LFSR state but focus on using only the lower 12 bits.
   - **Polynomial**: The Galois LFSR polynomial for 12 bits is \(x^{12} + x^{11} + x^{10} + x^4 + 1\), which corresponds to the hex value `0xB400` but shifted right by 4 bits to align with the 12-bit LFSR. This gives a complete cycle of 4095 iterations before repeating.
   - **LFSR Update**: The LFSR value is shifted right by one bit on each iteration. If the least significant bit (LSB) was 1 before the shift, we XOR the LFSR with the polynomial.

2. **Drawing Lines**:
   - **Line Index Calculation**: The LFSR generates a value that is taken modulo `maxLines` to ensure it fits within the buffer's line indices.
   - **Looping over 4096 Iterations**: The LFSR value can generate up to 4095 unique values before repeating. If the LFSR produces a value of `0` (which is unlikely with a good polynomial, but included as a reset condition), the LFSR is reset to its seed value.

3. **Resetting LFSR**:
   - **Reset Condition**: The LFSR resets after completing 4096 iterations by checking if the LFSR value returns to `0`. In typical LFSR implementation with a good polynomial, the sequence should cover all 4095 non-zero values before repeating. The LFSR is then reset to `1` to start the sequence anew.

### Example Usage:

```cpp
void executeLFSRLineDrawing() {
    drawLinesUsingLFSR(10);  // Draw 10 lines based on the LFSR order each time
}
```

Each time `executeLFSRLineDrawing` is called, it will draw a specified number of lines (e.g., 10) in an order determined by the 12-bit LFSR. The LFSR ensures that the order is pseudo-random but deterministic, and the sequence covers the entire range of possible lines in the buffer.

This approach allows for robust and efficient drawing based on a pseudo-random sequence generated by the LFSR, ensuring coverage of the entire range with 4096 iterations.
