To improve the code by removing redundant indices tracking, we can eliminate the need for the `drawnLines` array by leveraging the properties of the LFSR itself. Specifically, a well-chosen Galois LFSR with a maximum period (in this case, 4095 unique values before repeating) will inherently ensure that all possible values are generated before it starts repeating, assuming we handle the sequence correctly. 

We can then detect when the sequence has looped by checking if the LFSR returns to its initial seed value. Hereâ€™s how you can modify the code:

### Implementation

```cpp
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

// Define the number of iterations for the LFSR
#define LFSR_MAX_ITERATIONS 4096  // We will work with 4096 iterations

// Variables to store the current state of the LFSR and maximum lines
uint16_t lfsr = 1;  // Initial seed value for the 12-bit LFSR
int maxLines = MAX_LINES;  // Set this to the maximum number of lines in the buffer
int linesDrawn = 0;  // Track how many lines have been drawn

// Function to implement a 12-bit Galois LFSR
uint16_t galoisLFSR() {
    uint16_t lsb = lfsr & 1;  // Get the least significant bit
    lfsr >>= 1;               // Shift the LFSR right by 1
    if (lsb) {
        // Apply the polynomial (0xB400 corresponds to the polynomial x^12 + x^11 + x^10 + x^4 + 1)
        lfsr ^= 0xB400 >> 4;  // Use the relevant 12-bit polynomial, shifting by 4 to match 12 bits
    }
    return lfsr;
}

// Function to draw a specified number of lines based on the LFSR sequence
bool drawLinesUsingLFSR(int numLinesToDraw) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numLinesToDraw; i++) {
        // Generate the next LFSR value and mod by maxLines to ensure it's within the range
        uint16_t lfsrValue = galoisLFSR();
        uint16_t lineIndex = lfsrValue % maxLines;

        // Ensure the generated index is within the range of valid buffered lines
        if (lineIndex < lineBufferIndex) {
            drawBufferedLine(lineIndex);
            linesDrawn++;
        }

        // Check if all lines have been drawn
        if (linesDrawn >= LFSR_MAX_ITERATIONS - 1) {
            return true;  // All lines have been drawn
        }

        // Check if the LFSR has looped back to the initial seed value, indicating a complete cycle
        if (lfsr == 1 && linesDrawn > 0) {
            return true;  // LFSR has completed a cycle
        }
    }

    // Return false if there are still lines left to draw
    return false;
}

// Function to reset the LFSR and the drawing counter
void resetLFSRAndDrawing() {
    lfsr = 1;  // Reset the LFSR to the initial seed value
    linesDrawn = 0;  // Reset the lines drawn counter
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **LFSR Implementation**:
   - **LFSR Seed (`lfsr`)**: We continue using the 12-bit Galois LFSR. The polynomial ensures that we get 4095 unique values before the sequence repeats. 
   - **`linesDrawn` Counter**: Tracks the total number of lines drawn so far. This helps us identify when all possible lines have been drawn.

2. **Drawing Lines**:
   - **Line Index Calculation**: The LFSR generates the next index in the sequence. We then draw the corresponding line.
   - **Loop Detection**: The function checks whether the LFSR has returned to its initial seed value after the first cycle. If so, this indicates that the LFSR has completed its sequence.
   - **Completion Check**: The function also checks whether the total number of lines drawn has reached 4095 (`LFSR_MAX_ITERATIONS - 1`). If so, it returns `true` to indicate completion.

3. **Reset Function**:
   - **`resetLFSRAndDrawing()`**: This function resets both the LFSR and the `linesDrawn` counter, preparing for a new drawing sequence.

### Usage Example:

```cpp
void executeLFSRLineDrawing() {
    bool completed = drawLinesUsingLFSR(10);  // Draw 10 lines based on the LFSR order

    if (completed) {
        // All lines have been drawn
        resetLFSRAndDrawing();
        // You can now start a new drawing process if needed
    }
}
```

### Summary:

- This improved version removes the need for tracking drawn indices manually, instead relying on the properties of the LFSR to detect when all possible lines have been drawn.
- The function now returns `true` when the drawing process is complete, either because the LFSR has looped back to its initial state or because all possible lines have been drawn. This makes the code more efficient and easier to manage.
