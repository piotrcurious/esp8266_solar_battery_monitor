Maintaining consistency in variable types and contents across all header files is crucial, especially in large projects. Here are some strategies you can use to achieve this:

### 1. **Centralized Definitions**
   - **Use a Centralized Header File:** Define all your types, constants, and shared variables in one or a few centralized header files. For example, you might have a file called `common_types.h` or `global_definitions.h` that contains all the common typedefs, enums, structs, and extern variable declarations.
   - **Use `#include` Statements:** Make sure all other header files that need these definitions include this centralized header. This ensures that changes in the type or variable definition are automatically propagated across all files.

   ```c
   // common_types.h
   #ifndef COMMON_TYPES_H
   #define COMMON_TYPES_H

   typedef float VoltageType;

   // Other common definitions

   #endif // COMMON_TYPES_H
   ```

   ```c
   // telemetry_frame.hpp
   #include "common_types.h"

   typedef struct telemetry_frame {
       VoltageType voltage_ADC0;
       // Other fields...
   } telemetry_frame;
   ```

### 2. **Use of `typedef` and `using`**
   - **Abstract Data Types:** Use `typedef` (in C) or `using` (in C++) to abstract your types. This way, if you need to change the underlying type, you can do so in one place, and the change will propagate throughout your code.

   ```c
   // common_types.h
   typedef float VoltageType;

   // telemetry_frame.hpp
   typedef struct telemetry_frame {
       VoltageType voltage_ADC0;
   } telemetry_frame;
   ```

   Now, if you decide to change `VoltageType` from `float` to `double`, you only need to update `common_types.h`.

### 3. **Macros and Constants**
   - **Define Constants in One Place:** For any constant values, define them in a centralized header file using `#define` or `const`. This will prevent inconsistencies where different files might use different values for what should be the same constant.

   ```c
   // constants.h
   #define MAX_BUFFER_SIZE 128
   ```

   ```c
   // other_file.c
   #include "constants.h"
   char buffer[MAX_BUFFER_SIZE];
   ```

### 4. **`extern` Declarations**
   - **Declare Variables as `extern`:** For global variables that need to be shared across multiple files, declare them as `extern` in the header file and define them in one source file. This prevents multiple definitions and ensures that changes to the variable type or initial value are consistent.

   ```c
   // telemetry_frame.hpp
   #include "common_types.h"
   extern VoltageType globalVoltage;
   ```

   ```c
   // telemetry_frame.c
   #include "telemetry_frame.hpp"
   VoltageType globalVoltage = 0.0;
   ```

### 5. **Consistent Naming Conventions**
   - **Adopt a Naming Convention:** Use consistent naming conventions for your types and variables. This reduces the likelihood of errors and makes the code easier to understand and refactor.

### 6. **Automated Tools**
   - **Code Linters/Static Analyzers:** Use tools like `cppcheck`, `clang-tidy`, or integrated development environment (IDE) features to analyze your codebase and detect inconsistencies.
   - **Automated Refactoring:** Modern IDEs (like CLion, Visual Studio, etc.) offer automated refactoring tools that can help you rename types and variables across your entire codebase, ensuring consistency.

### 7. **Documentation and Code Reviews**
   - **Document Changes:** Whenever a change is made to a type or global variable, ensure it is documented. Having clear documentation helps maintainers understand why and how changes were made.
   - **Regular Code Reviews:** During code reviews, check for type consistency and ensure that all parts of the codebase reflect the latest changes.

By following these practices, you can maintain type and content consistency across all header files in your project, reducing the risk of bugs and making your code easier to maintain.
