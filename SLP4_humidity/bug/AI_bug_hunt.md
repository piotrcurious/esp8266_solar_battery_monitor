 This issue you're experiencing with the ESP32 WiFi and Bluetooth coexistence is interesting and not uncommon. The ESP32's default coexistence settings can sometimes lead to conflicts between WiFi and Bluetooth, especially when both are active simultaneously. Here are some thoughts and potential solutions to address your problem:

1. Coexistence settings: While you're using the default Arduino BT/WiFi coexistence settings, you might want to try adjusting these. The ESP-IDF (which Arduino ESP32 core is based on) provides more granular control over coexistence.

2. WiFi and Bluetooth priorities: You can try setting different priorities for WiFi and Bluetooth. If your application prioritizes WiFi connectivity, you can set WiFi to have higher priority.

3. Channel selection: Ensure that your WiFi channel doesn't overlap with Bluetooth frequencies. Channels 1, 6, and 11 in the 2.4 GHz band are typically recommended for minimal interference.

4. Power management: The ESP32's power management features can sometimes interfere with quick reconnections. You might want to experiment with different power save modes or even disable power management temporarily to see if it improves reconnection times.

5. Bluetooth connection interval: If possible, try increasing the Bluetooth connection interval. This can reduce the frequency of Bluetooth communications and potentially leave more airtime for WiFi.

6. WiFi beacon interval: Adjusting the WiFi beacon interval might help. A shorter interval could lead to faster reconnections, but it would increase power consumption.

7. Use ESP32's dual-core capabilities: You could dedicate one core to WiFi and another to Bluetooth to reduce contention.

8. Firmware update: Ensure you're using the latest ESP32 Arduino core and ESP-IDF versions, as coexistence issues are often addressed in updates.

To implement some of these suggestions, you might need to delve into the ESP-IDF level configurations. Here's a basic example of how you might adjust some of these settings:

```cpp
#include "esp_wifi.h"
#include "esp_bt.h"

void setup() {
  // ... your existing setup code ...

  // Set WiFi to higher priority than Bluetooth
  esp_wifi_set_ps(WIFI_PS_NONE);
  esp_bt_controller_enable(ESP_BT_MODE_BLE);
  esp_coex_preference_set(ESP_COEX_PREFER_WIFI);

  // Adjust WiFi beacon interval (in milliseconds)
  wifi_config_t wifi_config;
  esp_wifi_get_config(WIFI_IF_AP, &wifi_config);
  wifi_config.ap.beacon_interval = 100;  // Default is usually 100ms
  esp_wifi_set_config(WIFI_IF_AP, &wifi_config);

  // ... rest of your setup code ...
}
```

This code snippet disables WiFi power saving, enables Bluetooth in BLE mode, sets WiFi as the preferred coexistence mode, and adjusts the WiFi beacon interval.

Remember to test each change individually to isolate which setting has the most impact on your specific setup. Also, keep in mind that some of these changes might affect power consumption, so you'll need to balance performance with power efficiency based on your application's requirements.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these suggestions or provide more code examples?

 Thank you for the detailed feedback on the suggestions. Your observations are valuable and help narrow down the potential causes. Let's focus on the channel interference hypothesis and explore some other possibilities:

1. Channel Interference:
Your observation about channel switching is insightful. The ESP32's coexistence algorithm might indeed be causing channel hopping, which could interfere with the client's ability to associate quickly. To test this theory, we could try to:

a) Fix the WiFi channel:
```cpp
wifi_config_t wifi_config = {
    .ap = {
        .channel = 1,  // Choose a fixed channel (1, 6, or 11 recommended)
        .max_connection = 4,
        .authmode = WIFI_AUTH_WPA2_PSK,
        .ssid_hidden = 0
    },
};
esp_wifi_set_config(WIFI_IF_AP, &wifi_config);
```

b) Disable WiFi auto channel selection:
```cpp
esp_wifi_set_country_code("US", true);
esp_wifi_set_protocol(WIFI_IF_AP, WIFI_PROTOCOL_11B | WIFI_PROTOCOL_11G | WIFI_PROTOCOL_11N);
```

2. Bluetooth and WiFi Timing:
Since the issue occurs specifically when Bluetooth is connected, even without data transfer, it might be related to how the ESP32 schedules Bluetooth and WiFi operations. We could try adjusting the Bluetooth parameters:

```cpp
esp_bt_controller_config_t bt_cfg = BT_CONTROLLER_INIT_CONFIG_DEFAULT();
bt_cfg.ble_max_conn = 3;
bt_cfg.bt_max_acl_conn = 3;
bt_cfg.bt_sco_datapath = BT_SCO_DATA_PATH_PCM;
bt_cfg.normal_connect_timeout = 10000;  // Increase timeout
esp_bt_controller_init(&bt_cfg);
```

3. Monitor CPU Usage:
To check if there's a potential deadlock or resource contention, we could monitor CPU usage during these long reconnection periods:

```cpp
#include "esp_timer.h"
#include "esp_system.h"

void printCPUUsage() {
    uint32_t idle0 = esp_cpu_get_ccount();
    vTaskDelay(100 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
    uint32_t idle1 = esp_cpu_get_ccount();
    uint32_t diff = (idle1 - idle0) / (CONFIG_ESP32_DEFAULT_CPU_FREQ_MHZ * 1000);
    printf("CPU Idle: %d%%\n", diff);
}
```

Call this function periodically or when you detect a long reconnection time.

4. Analyze Reconnection Process:
To better understand what's happening during these long reconnections, we could add more detailed logging:

```cpp
#include "esp_wifi.h"
#include "esp_event.h"

void wifi_event_handler(void* arg, esp_event_base_t event_base,
                        int32_t event_id, void* event_data)
{
    if (event_base == WIFI_EVENT) {
        switch (event_id) {
            case WIFI_EVENT_AP_STACONNECTED:
                wifi_event_ap_staconnected_t* event = (wifi_event_ap_staconnected_t*) event_data;
                ESP_LOGI(TAG, "Station "MACSTR" joined, AID=%d", MAC2STR(event->mac), event->aid);
                break;
            case WIFI_EVENT_AP_STADISCONNECTED:
                wifi_event_ap_stadisconnected_t* event = (wifi_event_ap_stadisconnected_t*) event_data;
                ESP_LOGI(TAG, "Station "MACSTR" left, AID=%d", MAC2STR(event->mac), event->aid);
                break;
            default:
                ESP_LOGI(TAG, "Unhandled WiFi event: %d", event_id);
                break;
        }
    }
}
```

5. Check for Memory Issues:
Long delays could potentially be caused by memory fragmentation or leaks:

```cpp
void checkHeap() {
    ESP_LOGI(TAG, "Free heap: %d, Largest free block: %d",
             esp_get_free_heap_size(),
             heap_caps_get_largest_free_block(MALLOC_CAP_8BIT));
}
```

Call this function periodically to monitor heap status.

6. Bluetooth Serial Buffer:
Even if the Bluetooth client isn't actively sending data, check if there's any buffered data that might be interfering:

```cpp
size_t available = SerialBT.available();
if (available > 0) {
    ESP_LOGI(TAG, "Bluetooth serial has %d bytes available", available);
}
```

These suggestions focus on investigating the channel interference hypothesis and providing more detailed diagnostics to help identify the root cause of the long reconnection times. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide more specific code examples?
