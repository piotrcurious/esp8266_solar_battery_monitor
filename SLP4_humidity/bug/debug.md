 Certainly. The issue of prolonged association times with ESP32 is indeed puzzling, especially when a simple retry would be much quicker. Let's explore potential reasons for this behavior and identify which steps in the association process might be stalling.

1. Authentication Phase:
   - Reason: If the ESP32 is struggling to process the authentication request quickly, it could lead to delays.
   - Possible stall: The ESP32 might be waiting for some internal process to complete before responding to the authentication request.

2. Association Phase:
   - Reason: After authentication, the actual association process might be delayed.
   - Possible stall: The ESP32 could be having trouble allocating resources for the new connection.

3. DHCP Process:
   - Reason: Although not strictly part of the WiFi association, DHCP can cause delays post-association.
   - Possible stall: If the DHCP server (on the ESP32) is slow to respond or allocate an IP, it could appear as a long association time.

4. Bluetooth Coexistence:
   - Reason: The ESP32's attempt to balance Bluetooth and WiFi operations might be causing delays.
   - Possible stall: The WiFi radio might be waiting for a time slot that doesn't conflict with Bluetooth operations.

5. Power Management:
   - Reason: Power-saving features might be interfering with quick associations.
   - Possible stall: The ESP32 might be in a low-power state and taking too long to wake up and process the association request.

6. Buffer Overflow:
   - Reason: If the ESP32's network buffers are full, it might delay processing new association requests.
   - Possible stall: The system might be waiting for buffers to clear before proceeding with the association.

7. CPU Overload:
   - Reason: If the ESP32's CPU is heavily loaded with other tasks, it might delay WiFi operations.
   - Possible stall: The WiFi task might be waiting for CPU time to process the association.

8. Firmware Bug:
   - Reason: There could be a bug in the ESP32's WiFi firmware causing occasional long delays.
   - Possible stall: An edge case in the firmware might be triggered, causing it to wait unnecessarily.

9. Interference and Retries:
   - Reason: Although you mentioned it's not retrying, there might be internal retries happening.
   - Possible stall: The ESP32 might be attempting internal retries before giving up, but not communicating this to the higher layers.

To investigate which step might be stalling, you could:

1. Enable detailed WiFi logging:
   ```cpp
   esp_log_level_set("wifi", ESP_LOG_VERBOSE);
   ```

2. Monitor the ESP32's console output during associations to see where the delay occurs.

3. Use a WiFi analyzer to monitor the actual packets being exchanged during the association process.

4. Implement timing checks at different stages of the association process:

   ```cpp
   #include "esp_wifi.h"
   #include "esp_event.h"

   void wifi_event_handler(void* arg, esp_event_base_t event_base,
                           int32_t event_id, void* event_data)
   {
       static uint32_t auth_start_time = 0;
       static uint32_t assoc_start_time = 0;

       if (event_base == WIFI_EVENT) {
           switch (event_id) {
               case WIFI_EVENT_AP_STACONNECTED:
                   {
                       wifi_event_ap_staconnected_t* event = (wifi_event_ap_staconnected_t*) event_data;
                       uint32_t now = esp_timer_get_time() / 1000;
                       ESP_LOGI(TAG, "Station "MACSTR" joined, AID=%d", MAC2STR(event->mac), event->aid);
                       ESP_LOGI(TAG, "Authentication time: %d ms", auth_start_time ? now - auth_start_time : 0);
                       ESP_LOGI(TAG, "Association time: %d ms", assoc_start_time ? now - assoc_start_time : 0);
                       auth_start_time = assoc_start_time = 0;
                   }
                   break;
               case WIFI_EVENT_AP_STASTART:
                   auth_start_time = esp_timer_get_time() / 1000;
                   ESP_LOGI(TAG, "Station started authentication");
                   break;
               case WIFI_EVENT_AP_STADISCONNECTED:
                   ESP_LOGI(TAG, "Station disconnected");
                   break;
               default:
                   ESP_LOGI(TAG, "Unhandled WiFi event: %d", event_id);
                   break;
           }
       }
   }
   ```

5. Check system tasks and memory usage during the association process:

   ```cpp
   void print_system_info() {
       ESP_LOGI(TAG, "Free heap: %d", esp_get_free_heap_size());
       ESP_LOGI(TAG, "Min free heap: %d", esp_get_minimum_free_heap_size());
       // Print task states
       char buf[1000];
       vTaskList(buf);
       ESP_LOGI(TAG, "Task List:\n%s", buf);
   }
   ```

6. Monitor Bluetooth activity during WiFi associations to check for correlation.

By implementing these diagnostics, you should be able to pinpoint where the association process is stalling. Once identified, you can focus on optimizing that specific part of the process or potentially implement a manual retry mechanism if a certain timeout is exceeded.

Would you like me to provide more detailed code for any of these diagnostic approaches?
