simple and low power tool to use esp8266 and epaper display to display voltage

extras :

- enables a pin when voltage exceeds certain threshold - allows to f.e. charge a powerbank

- goes to deep sleep when voltage is below certain threshold

- elegant pin remapping helpers

- free i2c pins for additional sensors (f.e. current, pressure, humidity)

  TODO :
  RTC memory and graphing
  enabling RX/TX pins in esp8266 as GPIO does not work,
  one has to use i2c pins . sorry.
