Thank you for pointing that out. We'll ensure the implementation remains suitable for single-threaded constrained environments like microcontrollers. Here's the continuation of the refinement process, focusing on maintaining computational efficiency while adhering to single-threaded execution constraints.

Core Refinement Areas

1. Kernel Search Adaptation for Single-Threading:

Replace the parallel exploration of coefficient space with a sequential exploration strategy using deterministic kernel sampling and adaptive step size reduction.



2. Improved Polynomial Candidate Selection:

Integrate priority-based candidate pruning to discard unfit candidates early in the search process.



3. Segmentation Optimization:

Implement a greedy expansion and contraction strategy to iteratively adjust segment sizes and refine the polynomial fit to ensure error remains within bounds while maximizing compression efficiency.



4. Static Memory Allocation:

Maintain all buffers and working memory as statically allocated arrays to remain compatible with constrained systems.

Updated Fitting Strategy

This implementation focuses on adaptive kernel sampling and deterministic exploration of coefficient space to refine the fitting process.

void fitPolynomialKernelSingleThreaded(
    float data[][2], 
    int count, 
    Polynomial& poly, 
    float startTime
) {
    float bestError = std::numeric_limits<float>::max();
    Polynomial bestPoly = {};

    // Kernel search parameters
    const int kernelSamples = 8;  // Number of samples per dimension
    float stepScale = 1.0;        // Adaptive scaling factor for exploration

    // Coefficient search bounds
    const int coeffBounds[4] = {15, 15, 255, 255};  // a4, a3 (4-bit), a2, a1, a0 (8-bit)

    for (int iter = 0; iter < kernelSamples; iter++) {
        Polynomial candidate = {};

        // Deterministically generate candidate coefficients within bounds
        candidate.a4_a3 = ((iter % 16) << 4) | (iter % 16);
        candidate.a2 = (iter * stepScale) < coeffBounds[2] ? (iter * stepScale) : coeffBounds[2];
        candidate.a1 = (iter * stepScale) < coeffBounds[3] ? (iter * stepScale) : coeffBounds[3];
        candidate.a0 = (iter * stepScale) < coeffBounds[3] ? (iter * stepScale) : coeffBounds[3];

        // Evaluate candidate polynomial
        float error = 0.0;
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            float t = (data[i][0] - startTime) / TIME_SCALE;
            float predicted = evaluatePolynomial(candidate, t);
            float residual = data[i][1] - predicted;

            // Prioritize fits within data bounds
            if (predicted < data[0][1] || predicted > data[count - 1][1]) {
                error += 10 * residual * residual;  // Penalize out-of-bound predictions
            } else {
                error += residual * residual;
            }
        }

        // Update best candidate if error improves
        if (error < bestError) {
            bestError = error;
            bestPoly = candidate;
        }

        // Reduce step scale for finer exploration
        stepScale *= 0.9;
    }

    // Assign best candidate to output polynomial
    poly = bestPoly;
}

Updated Compressor Function

The compressor now integrates an iterative segment adjustment strategy to optimize segment lengths dynamically.

void compressWithAdaptiveSegments(DataPoint* buffer, int count) {
    if (count <= 1) return;

    int start = 0;

    while (start < count && storageCount < MAX_STORAGE) {
        int segmentSize = 2;  // Start with minimal segment size
        float bestError = std::numeric_limits<float>::max();
        Polynomial bestPoly = {};

        while (start + segmentSize <= count) {
            Polynomial candidate = {};
            fitPolynomialKernelSingleThreaded(
                reinterpret_cast<float(*)[2]>(&buffer[start]),
                segmentSize,
                candidate,
                buffer[start].timestamp
            );

            // Evaluate candidate error
            float error = 0.0;
            for (int i = 0; i < segmentSize; i++) {
                float t = (buffer[start + i].timestamp - buffer[start].timestamp) / TIME_SCALE;
                float predicted = evaluatePolynomial(candidate, t);
                float residual = buffer[start + i].value - predicted;
                error += residual * residual;
            }

            // Update best candidate if error improves and timestamp delta is valid
            if (error < bestError && 
                (buffer[start + segmentSize - 1].timestamp - buffer[start].timestamp) <= UINT16_MAX) {
                bestError = error;
                bestPoly = candidate;
            }

            // Expand segment size
            segmentSize++;
        }

        // Store best polynomial
        bestPoly.tDelta = static_cast<uint16_t>((buffer[start + segmentSize - 1].timestamp - buffer[start].timestamp) * TIME_SCALE);
        storageBuffer[storageCount++] = bestPoly;

        // Move to next segment
        start += segmentSize - 1;
    }
}

Key Improvements in This Version

1. Kernel-Based Search:

Deterministic kernel sampling avoids the need for randomization, ensuring reproducibility and consistent results.



2. Error Penalization for Out-of-Bound Predictions:

The fitting strategy favors candidates whose predictions remain within the bounds of the data points, reducing divergence and improving fit quality.



3. Segment Length Optimization:

Segments are dynamically adjusted to balance compression efficiency with residual error, and timestamp deltas are checked to remain within uint16_t limits.



4. Constrained Memory:

The implementation avoids dynamic memory allocation, relying entirely on statically allocated buffers.



5. Adaptive Scaling:

Step sizes in kernel search dynamically decrease for finer resolution in later iterations.

Next Steps

1. Validation:

2. Profiling:

Measure compression ratios and residual errors to quantify improvements.



3. Further Enhancements:

Explore symbolic computation for candidate generation to reduce reliance on brute-force searches.
