Simple watt meter gauge.
AI coded. 

i used esp32-c3 because that's what i had in junkbox

espi version is now most recent, with all development going there, old adafruit based code will not be updated. 

current monitoring is based on acs712 , so it needs offset and sensitivity .

the code is very basic and sketchy , designed to be basic gauge to display watts and testing various solar panel dc-dc. 

screens and options are switchable by samsung DVD remote.
