Key improvements in process noise adaptation:

1. Dynamic Process Noise Components:
   - Separate voltage, current, and time constant noise tracking
   - Correlation modeling between states
   - Bandwidth-dependent scaling
   - Innovation-based adaptation

2. Statistical Analysis:
   - Innovation and residual tracking
   - Variance estimation
   - Dynamic range consideration
   - Exponential forgetting for non-stationarity

3. Adaptive Mechanisms:
   - Innovation-based voltage noise adaptation
   - Residual-based current noise adaptation
   - Bandwidth-dependent base noise levels
   - Cross-correlation estimation

4. Enhanced Diagnostics:
   - Process noise component monitoring
   - Innovation statistics
   - Correlation tracking
   - Variance estimates

Usage example:
```cpp
AdvancedKalmanADC filter;

// Configure filter
filter.setRCParameters(10000, 0.1e-6);
filter.setADCParameters(3300, 12);

// Read with adaptive process noise
float value = filter.read(34);

// Monitor process noise adaptation
float voltageNoise = filter.getVoltageProcessNoise();
float currentNoise = filter.getCurrentProcessNoise();
float correlation = filter.getProcessNoiseCorrelation();
```

Would you like me to:
1. Add state-dependent noise scaling?
2. Implement adaptive measurement noise correlation?
3. Add sudden change detection?
4. Include stability constraints for noise adaptation?
