Key improvements in adaptive sampling:

1. Dynamic Rate Adjustment:
   - Bandwidth-based minimum rate (Nyquist criterion)
   - SNR-based rate adjustment
   - Slew rate monitoring
   - Signal amplitude tracking

2. Intelligent Sample Count:
   - Variable number of samples based on signal characteristics
   - Bandwidth-to-sample-rate ratio optimization
   - Minimum/maximum bounds enforcement

3. Precise Timing Control:
   - Microsecond-level timing accuracy
   - Compensation for processing delays
   - Consistent sample intervals

4. Signal Analysis:
   - Real-time bandwidth estimation
   - Amplitude tracking
   - Slew rate monitoring
   - Noise floor estimation

Usage example:
```cpp
AdvancedKalmanADC filter;

// Basic configuration
filter.setRCParameters(10000, 0.1e-6);
filter.setADCParameters(3300, 12);

// Read with adaptive sampling
float value = filter.read(34);  // Automatic sample count
// or
float value = filter.read(34, 10);  // Suggested sample count

// Monitor signal characteristics
float bandwidth = filter.getCurrentBandwidth();
float noiseFloor = filter.getCurrentNoiseFloor();
float slewRate = filter.getCurrentSlewRate();
```

Would you like me to:
1. Add adaptive process noise based on sampling characteristics?
2. Implement multi-rate filtering?
3. Add signal quality metrics?
4. Include adaptive bandwidth tracking?
