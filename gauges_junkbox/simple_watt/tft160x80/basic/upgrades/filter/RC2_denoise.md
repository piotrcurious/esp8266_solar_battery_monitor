Key improvements in noise modeling:

1. Comprehensive Noise Sources:
   - Thermal (Johnson-Nyquist) noise
   - ADC quantization noise
   - Flicker (1/f) noise
   - Shot noise
   - Ambient/environmental noise

2. Spectral Analysis:
   - FFT-based noise spectrum analysis
   - Frequency-dependent noise characterization
   - Separate low and high frequency noise components

3. Dynamic Noise Adaptation:
   - Temperature-dependent noise modeling
   - Current-dependent shot noise
   - Frequency-dependent flicker noise
   - Adaptive process and measurement noise matrices

4. Enhanced Diagnostics:
   - Noise spectrum analysis
   - Individual noise component tracking
   - Temperature compensation

Usage example:
```cpp
AdvancedKalmanADC filter;

// Configure with temperature compensation
filter.setRCParameters(10000, 0.1e-6);
filter.setADCParameters(3300, 12);
filter.setTemperature(25.0);  // Set ambient temperature

// Read with noise analysis
float value = filter.read(34, 10);

// Get noise spectrum for analysis
const float* spectrum = filter.getNoiseSpectrum();
```

Would you like me to:
1. Add correlation analysis between noise components?
2. Implement adaptive sampling based on noise characteristics?
3. Add power spectral density estimation?
4. Include environmental noise rejection techniques?
